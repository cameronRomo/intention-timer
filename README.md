### Overview

Users will select an activity category, set the amount of time they want to spend on that activity, and start the timer. The app will log that activity to keep track of how the user has been spending their time.

### Learning Goals
* Develop skills in writing:
  * semantic HTML
  * clean & organized CSS styles
  * DRY and organized JavaScript
* Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM

* Understand event bubbling and use event delegation on dynamic elements

* Persist data across page refreshes by using local storage
### Functionality
**Main Page**

When the user loads the page, a they should see the basic framework of the site. From here, the user can choose a category (intention), enter a description for what they would like to accomplish, and enter values for minutes and seconds. Then the user can click the start activity and be taken to the next page.

**Timer**

Once the user has been taken to the timer page, they will see their description displayed, and a motivational message followed by a "Ready?" prompt. When "Ready?" is clicked the timer will begin to count down to zero. Once zero is reached the activity is marked complete. If so desired the activity can be stored in past activities and displayed in the past activities column by clicking "Log Activity".
